    <h2>History of Pressure Washing</h2>
        <p>
        Pressure Washing was invented in 1920 by William dinkle. it was during the prohibation time and while making whiskey in his garage, a hot steam tub got a hole and began shooting hot steam. somehow, in my opinion by the higher power that felt the world needed pressure washing, william dinkle used it to clean the grease on his floors. he found it extremely effective. Since then many innovations and changes have been made with better pumps. presently there are two main types of pumps, <span>axial</span> and <span>trinomal</span>.
