                    <h3 class="gitnain">Regulation & Environmental requirements</h3>
                    <p>Hawaii / Honolulu: hindi pinapayagan ang direct wastewater discharge sa storm drains; kailangan ng BMPs at minsan temporary discharge permits or wash-water containment/reclaim systems para sa commercial jobs. I-highlight na Kintab sumusunod sa local BMPs at may reclaim system — malaking selling point.</p>
