                <dd>I want to do this because I want to start my own pressure washing business. I want to gain experience in running my own business and apply the things I learned in BUSM 180. One piece of advice I received was to start a business in collage. It doesn't matter what it is, if it is successful, just start one for the experience. That was my Business professors one regret- he didn't start his own business in collage. Im excited because I have nothing to lose. Now is the perfect time while I am young and single.<dd>
