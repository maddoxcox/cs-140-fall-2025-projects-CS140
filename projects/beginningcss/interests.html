        <p>I love <span class="boards">Surfing!</span> growing up I loved to <span class="boards">skateboard</span> and <span class="boards">snowboard</span>... anything with a board. However growing up in vegas it was difficult to pursue my passion for surfing. surfing needs the ocean and Las Vegas is the farthest thing from the ocean, a desert.</p>
        <p>in the umbrella of surfing there are many different types. I enjoy logging and started to shortboard. "logging" is surfing with a longboard that high perfomance and to do sharp turns and allow the rider to ride on the nose. short boarding is a surfboard that is short and pointy it is used to go fast and make very sharp turns on the face of the wave.</p>

    <p>a relative link is a link that doesn't have the path part of the URL. only the domain name. for example <a href="profile.html">profile page</a>
    an aboslute link is a link that contains the whole URL and goes outide of the file. for example <a href="https://www.surfer.com/">surfing website</a></p>
