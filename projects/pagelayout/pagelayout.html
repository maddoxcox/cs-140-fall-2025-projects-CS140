        <p>there are many different brands in skateboarding. there is more than meets the eye as well. From an outside perspective one might simply say oh yeah that is typical and there is not a lot meaning. However there is a lot of meaning in the brands. </p>
        <p>There is a hiearchy in skateboard brands not just based on quality but also status as well. In skating there is something core and not core. one would want to be core. the others would be referred to as coporate or poser. core is something that embodies the true, raw essance of skateboarding. However now that business like nike and adidas have entered skateboarding a lot of money has been pumped in and it has become more coporate. Skaters do not like that.</p>
