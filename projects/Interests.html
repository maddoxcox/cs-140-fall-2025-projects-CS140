        <h1>Maddox's interests- SurfingüèÑ</h1>
        <p>I love Surfing! growing up I loved to skateboard and snowboard... anything with a board. However growing up in vegas it was difficult to pursue my passion for surfing. surfing needs the ocean and Las Vegas is the farthest thing from the ocean, a desert.</p>
        <p>in the umbrella of surfing there are many different types. I enjoy logging and started to shortboard. "logging" is surfing with a longboard that high perfomance and to do sharp turns and allow the rider to ride on the nose. short boarding is a surfboard that is short and pointy it is used to go fast and make very sharp turns on the face of the wave.</p>
