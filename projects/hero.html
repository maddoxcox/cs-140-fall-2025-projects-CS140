        <h1>Maddox's hero in surfing- Andy Irons</h1>
        <p>Andy Irons was a pro surfer from kawai. He had a rough home life and found comfort in surfing. He was the only rival to kelly slater and and actually beat him in the world title. he was sponsored by billabong and was kind of the "dark horse" of surfing. I love his personality and his grit. He is just raw, core surfing. hard turns, fast carves, and baggy boardshorts!</p>
